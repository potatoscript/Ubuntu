## Introduction
Ubuntu is a popular Linux distribution based on Debian. It is widely used for development, servers, and desktop computing. This tutorial provides a comprehensive guide to Ubuntu, from installation to advanced usage.

## Installation
1. Download the latest Ubuntu ISO from [ubuntu.com](https://ubuntu.com/).
2. Create a bootable USB using tools like Rufus or Balena Etcher.
3. Boot from the USB and follow the installation steps.
4. Choose installation type (Normal, Minimal, or Custom).
5. Set up user credentials and wait for the installation to complete.
6. Restart and remove the USB drive.

## Basic Commands
```bash
uname -a      # Show system information
lsb_release -a # Show Ubuntu version
hostnamectl    # Display hostname and system info
whoami         # Show current user
pwd            # Print working directory
``` 

## File Management
```bash
ls -l          # List files with details
cd /path       # Change directory
mkdir newdir   # Create a new directory
rm file        # Remove a file
cp source dest # Copy files
